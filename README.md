# Paintjob Packer
Paintjob Packer is a lightweight mod making tool for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator. It allows you to generate simple (airbrush) paintjob mods, with a focus on mods that support multiple vehicles.

## Functions

* Support for player-owned trailers, including those from DLCs
* Support for trucks using the newer accessory-based paintjob system, like the Scania S and MAN TGX Euro 6
* Built-in support for 40 modded trucks
* Support for separate paintjobs for each cabin of a truck, in case a single texture doesn't work for all of them
* Very lightweight - starts instantly, can generate a 50-paintjob mod in under a second (that made testing the loading screen a challenge :) )
