# Paintjob Packer
Mod making tool for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator

**Hey for now**, this tool is made for my own personal use. Maybe one day I'll make it easier for others to use, but right now it's kinda complex in the way it works, and every mod generated by it will be infected by Carsmaniac (the author will be Carsmaniac, every paintjob name will have the cm_ prefix, the descriptions will be in the format I use, etc.)

## Functions

**Generate trucksim paintjob mods that support multiple vehicles**

* Support for player-owned trailers
* Support for trucks using the new accessory-based paintjob system, like the Scania S and MAN TGX Euro 6
* Support for modded trucks
* Multiple different paintjobs within a single mod (for alternate liveries etc)
* Create descriptions both for Steam Workshop and in-game mod manager
* * Link to related mods/equivalent pack for the other game within Workshop description
* Manage existing paintjob mods, allowing the re-generation of files
* * Create add-ons for existing mods, adding support for additional vehicles

## Files

* `new pack.py`: Generates a full mod from the input file
* `existing pack.py`: Generates files needed to add specific vehicles to an existing mod, and/or re-generates description files
* `new pack.ini`: Input file for making a new mod from scratch
* `existing pack.ini`: Input file for all actions involving previously made mods
* `reference.txt`: List of all vehicles supported by the program
