Major feature to do list
- First-run function to set up folders & default lists and act as a tutorial
- Trailer support
- Function (within configure?) that tells you all the files you need to provide, and where to put them

user-facing-names branch
- Whenever displaying make, model or cabins show nice looking names
	- make_name, model_name, cabin_1_name etc
		-> make_name and model_name are not needed, only need cabin_x_name and database_name
	- database_name for new entries can be generated from make_name and model_name
- Remove all mention of "truck list"s in user-facing messages (see commit 6b7963c)
